# Advanced Single-File Plagiarism Detector

A comprehensive web-based plagiarism detection system built with Flask and Python. This application analyzes a single file against a database of previously uploaded documents, supports multiple file types, and generates detailed plagiarism reports with advanced similarity analysis.

## ðŸš€ Features

### Core Functionality
- **Single-File Analysis**: Upload one file to check against ALL previously uploaded documents
- **Database Comparison**: Compares against growing database of documents
- **Multi-Format Support**: TXT, PDF, DOCX, XLSX, Images (PNG, JPG, etc.)
- **Advanced Text Analysis**: Cosine similarity + sequence matching algorithms
- **OCR Support**: Extract text from images using Tesseract
- **Real-time Processing**: Instant plagiarism detection with detailed breakdowns
- **Persistent Storage**: SQLite database stores all documents for future comparisons

### User Interface
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful, responsive design with Bootstrap 5
- **Tabbed Interface**: Separate tabs for text input, file upload, and reports
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Detailed statistics, common words, similar sentences
- **Interactive Results**: Animated progress bars and color-coded risk levels
- **Export Functionality**: Download detailed JSON reports

### Report System
- **Detailed Reports**: Comprehensive analysis with recommendations
- **Report History**: View and manage all generated reports
- **Print Support**: Print-friendly report layouts
- **Risk Assessment**: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW risk levels
- **Recommendations**: AI-powered suggestions for improvement

### Privacy & Security
- **Local Processing**: All analysis done locally
- **File Cleanup**: Uploaded files are automatically deleted after processing
- **Secure Storage**: Document hashes prevent duplicate storage
- **No External APIs**: Complete privacy protection

## How It Works

The plagiarism detector uses two main algorithms:

1. **Cosine Similarity**: Measures the angle between text vectors in a high-dimensional space
2. **Sequence Similarity**: Uses difflib to compare word sequences between texts

The final similarity score is a weighted average of both methods (70% cosine, 30% sequence).

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Tesseract OCR (for image text extraction)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone or download** this repository to your local machine

2. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install Tesseract OCR** (for image processing):
   - **Windows**: Download from [GitHub](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)
   - **macOS**: `brew install tesseract`
   - **Linux**: `sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr`

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

### First Run
- The application will automatically create the SQLite database
- Uploads directory will be created automatically
- No additional configuration required

## ðŸ“– Usage

### Text Input Method
1. **Navigate to Text Input tab**
2. **Enter Texts**: Paste your original text and suspected text
3. **Click Check**: Press "Check for Plagiarism" or use Ctrl+Enter
4. **View Results**: See detailed similarity analysis with comprehensive breakdown

### Single-File Upload Method
1. **Navigate to File Upload tab**
2. **Select File**: Choose one file to analyze (supports multiple formats)
3. **Upload & Analyze**: Click "Analyze for Plagiarism"
4. **View Results**: Get comprehensive report comparing against all database documents
5. **Document Saved**: Your file is automatically saved to database for future comparisons

### Reports Management
1. **Navigate to Reports tab**
2. **View History**: See all generated reports with similarity scores
3. **Access Details**: Click eye icon to view full report
4. **Download**: Download JSON reports for external use

### Supported File Types
- **Text Files**: .txt
- **Documents**: .pdf, .docx, .doc
- **Spreadsheets**: .xlsx, .xls
- **Images**: .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .bmp, .tiff (with OCR)

## Similarity Levels

- **0-29%**: Original Content (Green)
- **30-59%**: Low Plagiarism Risk (Blue)
- **60-79%**: Moderate Plagiarism Risk (Yellow)
- **80-100%**: High Plagiarism Risk (Red)

## API Endpoint

The application also provides a REST API endpoint for programmatic access:

```bash
POST /api/check
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "text1": "Your first text here",
    "text2": "Your second text here"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
    "similarity": 0.75,
    "percentage": 75.0,
    "status": "Moderate Plagiarism Risk",
    "color": "warning",
    "cosine_similarity": 78.5,
    "sequence_similarity": 68.2,
    "details": "Cosine Similarity: 78.5%, Sequence Similarity: 68.2%"
}
```
